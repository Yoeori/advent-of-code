# Advent of Code repository
This code contains all of my implementations of the puzzles of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) from 2019 onwards (2018 might be added later).

Currently all of the puzzles are made in Rust. In 2019 mainly focused on learning Rust and this year (2020) focused on having a bit of fun. Once you have installed Rust and Cargo you can run a day by running (in the 2019 or 2020 folder):
```bash
$ cargo run -- {day}
```
